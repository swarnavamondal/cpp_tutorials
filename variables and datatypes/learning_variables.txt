In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false

to display variables - The cout object is used together with the << operator to display variables.
To combine both text and a variable, separate them with the << operator

constant variable:
When you do not want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values,
use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only)
