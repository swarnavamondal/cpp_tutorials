Strings in C++ are a sequence of characters used to represent text. 
C++ provides two main ways to work with strings: C-style strings and the `std::string` class from the Standard Template Library (STL).

there are two ways to initialie a string :
string str ="abcd";
char str[] = "abcd";

String concatenation can be done in 2 ways :
-by using + 
-by using .append()     //note : after using append string 1 will change to the addition of both strings 1 and 2

To find length of a string we can use .length() or .size()

taking input from user 
-using cin // cin can only take a single word input . 
using spaces or tabs will terminate the string and if u have initialized a string after that it will get assigned to that string

-using getline(cin,str) //this will allow you to input the string with spaces
