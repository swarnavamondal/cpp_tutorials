C++ Loops
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

C++ While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true

The Do/While Loop
The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, 
then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

C++ For Loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, 
use the for loop instead of a while loop

Nested Loops
It is also possible to place a loop inside another loop. This is called a nested loop.
The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop"

The foreach Loop
There is also a "for-each loop" (also known as ranged-based for loop), 
which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array (or other data structures)
