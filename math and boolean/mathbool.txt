c++ has a library called cmath. This library allows us to use different math functions and operations like:
round, min, max, sqrt, log.

boolean data types can store data of two kinds : true and false or 1 and 0
boolean conditions are also used in if-else statements and while loops and any other conditional statement scopes.
