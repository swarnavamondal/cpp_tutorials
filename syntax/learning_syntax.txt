#include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout . 

using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
if we dont use namespace std we have to use the keyword 'std' followed by :: operator

cout is an object which prints the desired output or variable given by the user

endl stands for end line . this makes sure while printing the next statement it is display in the different line.
you can also use \n which makes a new line.
if you want to print in a horizontal tab use \t

int main(){} is the main function, the scope inside { } is the code that will be executed.

return 0; this line ends the main function but not always nessecary

Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
single lined //
multi lined /* */
